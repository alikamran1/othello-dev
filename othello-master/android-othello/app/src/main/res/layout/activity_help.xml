    Reversi is a classic board game for two players just like chess, checkers and go. Black and white, the dark and the light,
    the good and the bad battle each other for victory. Reversi is a very dynamic board game; the board position can change
    dramatically with each move. Reversi is also known as Othello. \n\n

    Each reversi piece has a black side and a white side. On your turn, you place one piece on the board with your color facing up.
    You must place the piece so that an opponent's piece, or a row of opponent's pieces,
    is flanked by your pieces. All of the opponent's pieces between your pieces are then turned over to become your color."/>
